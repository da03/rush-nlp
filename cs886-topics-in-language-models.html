<h4>Coursework Overview</h4>
<p><strong>Presentations:</strong> Students will present one or more papers during the course. Presentations are crucial and should not be missed, as they significantly contribute to the class dynamics. If unforeseen circumstances arise, inform the instructor as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Final Project:</strong> Students will work on a final project that allows them to explore a topic related to language models in depth. Projects can be done individually or in groups of up to 3 members. Groups larger than this range require a justification and are subject to instructor approval.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Original Contribution:</strong> The primary aim of the project is to make an original contribution to the field. Ideally, the project should be of a quality that could potentially lead to a publication. This could involve, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Novel Research:</strong> Developing new methods, models, or insights in the field of language models.</li>
      <li><strong>Reproducibility Test:</strong> Attempting to replicate and possibly extend the results from a published paper, providing detailed analysis and commentary on the findings.</li>
      <li><strong>Negative Results:</strong> Investigating a hypothesis or method that did not yield expected results, with thorough documentation of the process and analysis of why it failed.</li>
      <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Conducting a comprehensive and critical survey of a specific area within language models, identifying gaps or trends that could inform future research. Even for surveys, the work should go beyond summarization to include thoughtful analysis and synthesis of the literature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proposal Submission:</strong> Mid-semester, students will submit a project proposal outlining their research question, hypothesis, and approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Presentation:</strong> At the end of the semester, each group will present their findings to the class.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Report:</strong> A detailed report summarizing the project, including research question, hypothesis, approach, results, and discussion, will be due after the presentation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Participation in every class is expected since discussion is crucial to the seminar format.</p>

<h4>Course Policies</h4>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All submitted work must be original. Plagiarism is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Regular attendance and active participation are expected. Absences should be communicated in advance, and unexcused absences may impact the participation grade.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Students requiring accommodations should reach out early in the semester to discuss necessary arrangements.</p>

<h4>Acknowledgment:</h4>
<p>This syllabus was adapted from the syllabus of CS187 at Harvard, developed by my PhD co-advisor, Professor <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/">Stuart Shieber</a>.</p>
